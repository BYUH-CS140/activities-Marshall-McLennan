    <h2>Materials Needed</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>1 sheet of paper</li>
      <l1>A flat surface to fold the paper</l1><!-- Needs to be list item, 'li'. Not list one, 'l1' -->
    </ul>
  </section>
  <section id="steps">
    <h2>Folding Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>Lay the paper on a flat surface.</li>
      <li>Fold the paper in half vertically.</li>
      <li>Unfold the paper and fold each of the top corners into the center line.</li>
      <li>Fold the top edges again to the center.</li>
      <li>Fold the plane in half lengthwise.</li>
      <li>Fold the wings down, matching the top edges of the wings with the bottom edge of the body.</li>
    </ol><!-- Needs to correspond to opening, so changed it from '/ul', to '/ol' -->
  </section>
  <section id="tips"><!-- Changed the case of 'T' to 't' to match it's call on line 15 -->
    <h2>Extra Tips</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Make sure your folds are as sharp as possible.</li>
      <li>This airplane has stiff wings and can tolerate fast throwing speeds.</li>
      <li>Throw it as hard as you can for maximum distance and speed.</li>
    </ul><!-- Switched these two lines because the unordered list closed but had a list item on the outside of it -->
