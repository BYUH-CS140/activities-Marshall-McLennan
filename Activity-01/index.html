    <h3>If you were a boat, what type would you be?</h3>
    <p>
        The Camakau, a Fijian canoe made of iron wood called vesi, it is held
        together using the fibers from the coconut husk or sennit rope and the sap from the
        bread fruit tree. I believe the camakau represents my personality because of the significance 
        it has in my culture.
