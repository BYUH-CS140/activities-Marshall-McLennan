        <h2>Sydney</h2>
        <p>Sdyney is the largest city in Australia, known for its iconic landmarks such as the Sydney Opera House and the Sydney Harbour Bridge. 
            The city is a vibrant cultural hub, offering a mix of beautiful beaches, world-class dining, and a rich arts scene. Visitors can explore the Royal Botanic Garden, 
            take a ferry ride across the harbour, or enjoy the lively atmosphere of Darling Harbour. Sydney's diverse neighborhoods each have their own unique charm, making it a must-visit destination for travelers.

        <p>I was born in Sydney, Australia but I only lived for a few years. Around fifth grade I moved to Fiji with my family. I have a lot of memories of Sydney, but the one that stands out the most is when I went to the Sydney Opera House with my family. 
            It was a beautiful day and we took a tour of the building, learning about its history and architecture. The views of the harbour were breathtaking, and I remember feeling so lucky to be there.
