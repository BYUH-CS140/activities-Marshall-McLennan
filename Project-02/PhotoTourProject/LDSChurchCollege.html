        <h2>LDS Church College</h2>
        <p>There are several schools in Fiji, but the one I attended was the LDS Church College. It is located in Suva and is known for its strong academic programs and emphasis on values-based education. 
            The school has a diverse student body and offers a range of extracurricular activities, including sports, music, and cultural events.
             The college aims to provide a well-rounded education that prepares students for success in their future endeavors.It is in this school
             that I received my scholarship to come to Hawaii and attend BYU-Hawaii. I am super grateful for this opportunity, having a lot of people that share the same values and goals as you creates such a unique environment.
