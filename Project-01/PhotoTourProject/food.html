        <h2>Red Pork and Rice</h2>
        <p>Red Pork and Rice is a traditional Fijian dish that is loved by many. It consists of marinated pork cooked in a rich, flavorful sauce,
             served over a bed of fluffy rice. The dish is often accompanied by fresh vegetables and is a staple at family gatherings and
              celebrations in Fiji. The combination of spices and the tenderness of the pork make it a must-try for anyone visiting the islands.
            Me personally this dish holds a special place in my heart as it was one of the meals my friends and I would enjoy around the table 
        as we talked about school and stuff.</p>
